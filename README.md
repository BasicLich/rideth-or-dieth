# rideth-or-dieth
Construct 3 project for my Miz Jam 1 entry: https://robot-girlfriend.itch.io/rideth-or-dieth

To view, download the c3 file and open in editor.construct.net (or on your desktop app). I've done my best to comment each block of code to explain my thought process and how I approached some of the problems. Keep in mind that I am still a beginner to programming and gamedev at large so this is intended as a resource for other folks who are just starting out to see how another dev solved some things in Construct. 

Feel free to reach out on Twitter or in comments if you have any questions.
